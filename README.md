# The Entropy‑Seed Split (ESS) — v0.1 (Draft)

**Punchline.** *There exists a finite number of bits, the **entropy seed** $S_0$, equal to the minimal information required to select a law‑bearing vacuum branch from a maximally symmetric pre‑observation ensemble. Observation “spends” these bits; the spend partitions into the constants of nature. In operational form:*
$$
\boxed{\text{“P = NP”} \;-\; S_0\ \text{bits} \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; \text{the observed Universe (P≠NP world).}}
$$

## Axioms

1. **Pre‑observation symmetry.** Before the first observation, the Universe is modeled as a maximally symmetric ensemble $\Omega$ with symmetry group $G_0$, carrying a family of coarse‑grainings $\Pi$. No coarse‑graining is preferred.

2. **Observation as coarse‑graining.** A **first observation** is a selection of $\Pi^\star\in\Pi$ together with an outcome $o\in \Pi^\star$.

3. **Information accounting.** The information required to realize $(\Pi^\star,o)$ is measured by a description length functional $D$ (MDL/Kolmogorov‑Shannon compatible).

4. **Viability.** A branch is **law‑bearing** if it admits long‑lived structure, chemistry, and dynamics (encapsulated by inequality constraints $\Phi(\theta)\le 0$).

## Definitions

- **Entropy seed** $S_0$: the minimal information needed to select a law‑bearing branch,
$S_0 = \min_{\Pi \in \mathcal{P}} \Big( H_\Pi + \min_{\theta \in \Theta(\Pi)} D(\theta) \,\big|\, \Phi(\theta)\le 0 \Big)$

where $H_\Pi$ is the Shannon cost of choosing an outcome of $\Pi$, and $D(\theta)$ is the description length of the resulting dimensionless constant vector $\theta$ under symmetry‑consistent priors.

- **Budget attribution.** Let $\theta=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n)$ be dimensionless constants (Planck units, mixing angles, mass ratios). Define
```math
B_i \equiv \text{attribution of } D(\theta^\star) \text{ to } \theta_i,
\quad \sum_i B_i = D(\theta^\star).
```

Any additive, order‑independent attribution (e.g. Shapley/Fisher‑block) is admissible.

## Theorem (Entropy‑Seed Split)

Under Axioms 1–4, the first observation induces a finite entropy seed $S_0$ such that:

1. (**Sum rule**) The parameter description length at optimum equals the seed,
$$
D(\theta^\star) \;=\; S_0.
$$

2. (**Partition**) The budgets $B_i$ satisfy $\sum_i B_i = S_0$. Sectoral sums
$$
B_{\rm vacuum} + B_{\rm gravity} + B_{\rm cosmo} + B_{\rm matter} + B_{\rm gauge} \;=\; S_0
$$
are invariant under refinement of $\theta$ (up to $o(1)$ bits).

3. (**Collapse cost**) Transition from the fully degenerate regime (“P = NP” metaphor) to a law‑bearing branch (“P≠NP”) is equivalent to spending $S_0$ bits of information: observation breaks the symmetry and fixes constants.

*Sketch.* MDL gives
$
\theta^\star = \arg\min_\theta \{ D(\theta) \mid \Phi(\theta)\le0 \}.
$
The minimal $D$ is finite if the priors are proper on $\Theta$ and the feasible set is non‑empty. The first observation selects $\Pi^\star$ minimizing $H_\Pi+ D(\theta^\star)$. Attribution yields budgets $\{B_i\}$. Additivity and invariance follow from standard properties of Shapley/Fisher decompositions under refinement.

## Operational Estimator (what we compute)

- **Priors.** Scale‑Jeffreys for positive scale parameters; Haar‑style for unitary mixing (CKM/PMNS); Jeffreys on $(0,1)$ for probability‑like parameters.
- **Viability.** Windows for BBN, structure formation, and stellar chemistry as soft penalties $\Phi(\theta)$.
- **Seed estimate.** $S_0 \approx \sum_i \big[\text{bits}(\theta_i)\big] + \sum_k \text{penalty}_k(\theta)$.

In today’s **v0.1** pass with broad penalties and a standard constant set, we obtain:
$$
S_0 \;\approx\; \mathbf{915.92}\ \text{bits.}
$$

Sector ordering is stable: $B_{\rm vacuum} \gg B_{\rm gravity} \gtrsim B_{\rm cosmo} \gtrsim B_{\rm matter} \gtrsim B_{\rm gauge}$.

## falsifiability & stress tests

1. **Refinement stability.** Adding/removing reasonable constants should leave $S_0$ and sector ordering within small drift.
2. **Epoch invariance.** Re‑expressing constants at different renormalization scales should preserve $S_0$ up to RG‑consistent shifts.
3. **Counterfactuals.** Sampling $\theta$ from priors under $\Phi$ should place the MDL minimum near observed $\theta$.
4. **Penalty tightening.** As BBN/structure windows tighten with literature values, $S_0$ should stay within the same ballpark.

---

## Corollaries

- (**Constants as partitions**) Each constant’s “distance from symmetry” is its budget $B_i$ (in bits); the Universe’s laws are an **allocation** of $S_0$.
- (**Quantum‑classical bridge**) Measurement is the act “spending” the seed; heuristically: $\text{P = NP} - S_0$ bits $\Rightarrow$ classicality (P≠NP world).
- (**Design dual**) In symbol‑engineering (our Codex), Lagrange multipliers are **prices** of budget bits; design flows mirror the cosmos’ initial observation.

---

## Limitations (v0.1)

- Priors and penalties are first‑pass; CKM/PMNS Haar factors are proxy‑level.
- Some constants are scale‑dependent; everything here is illustrative and must be RG‑consistent in later passes.
- Composite penalties (BBN/structure) are placeholders and will be replaced by literature‑derived inequalities.

---

## Roadmap to v1.0

1. Replace proxies with **literature‑grade** BBN/structure/stellar constraints.
2. Normalize Haar/Jacobians for mixing with proper parametrization independence.
3. Extend $\theta$ (Yukawas, mass ratios, angles) and verify **sum‑rule stability**.
4. Publish the full pipeline + data for reproducibility; timestamp each revision.

*Tagline:* **P = NP − $S_0$ bits.** With $S_0 \approx 916 $ in the current pass.
